    "message": "This extension makes it possible to quickly navigate to a particular folder in  the folder pane simply by typing the first few letters of the folder name when  the folder pane has focus. Note that  single-letter Thunderbird short-cuts (such as the short-cuts for moving to the  next and previous unread message) do not work in the folder pane when key navigation is enabled.  Therefore, There is an option to turn key navigation on/off, as well as for adding this item to the \"Go\" menu."
