<h1>The keynav Add-on</h1>

<p>keynav is an add-on for Thunderbird that allows the folder pane to be 
quickly navigated by typing part or all of a folder name when it has the focus.</p>
<p>Note that  single-letter Thunderbird short-cuts (such 
"n" and "p" which move to the  next and previous unread messages respectively) do not 
work in the folder pane when key navigation is enabled.  Therefore, There is an 
option to turn key navigation on/off, as well as for adding this item to the 
"Go" menu.</p>

utilities are needed for building the extension: make, cat, 
grep, head, sed, zip.</p>

<p>Building the extension is straightforward. After cloning the repository
or downloading an archive of the repository and extracting it to a
directory, simply type "make" at the command prompt to build the .xpi 
file.</p>

<p>In addition, "make showversion" will display the source code version and 
"make clean" will clean up the repository folder structure, deleting the zip 
file, as well as files with names like *.bak, etc.</p>

<p>Once the xpi file has been built, it can be installed using the instructions given above in <a href="#install">How to Install keynav</a>.</p>
