# keynav

This is an addon for Thunderbird that allows the folder tree to be 
quickly navigated by typing part or all of a folder name when the 
folder tree has the focus.

# Building From Source

In addition to a shell such as bash, the following standard Linux/Unix  
utilities will be required in order to build the extension: make, cat, 
grep, head, sed, zip.

Building the extension is straightforward. After cloning the repository
or downloading an archive of the repository and extracting it to a
directory, simply type "make" at the command prompt to build the .xpi 
file.
