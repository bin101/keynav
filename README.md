# keynav

This is an add-on for Thunderbird that allows the folder tree to be 
quickly navigated by typing part or all of a folder name when the 
folder tree has the focus.

# Building From Source

In addition to a shell such as bash, the following standard Linux/Unix  
utilities will be required in order to build the extension: make, cat, 
grep, head, sed, zip.

Building the extension is straightforward. After cloning the repository
or downloading an archive of the repository and extracting it to a
directory, simply type "make" at the command prompt to build the .xpi 
file.

#Installing the add-on

Once you have the xpi file, it can be installed using the following procedure.

  1. Open Thunderbird.
  2. Click on the Tools menu and then click on Add-ons to open the Add-ons Manager.
  3. Click on the "Tools for all add-ons" button, which appears as a cog wheel. It is just before the "Search all add-ons" edit field in the tab order.
      * Note to screen-reader users. The button needs to be clicked using the mouse by simulating a mouse click at the physical position of the button on screen.
  4. Click on the "Install Add-on from file" item in the pop-up menu that appears.
  5. An open file dialog wil appear. Use it to select the xpi file for the keynav add-on.
  6. Follow the instructions to complete the installation. You will probably be asked to restart Thunderbird.
